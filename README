aws_automate is a Twill (twill.idyll.org) module that allows the user to manage
Amazon AWS instances (start-up, shutdown) without needing to type in their
security credentials every time

To use this package, you must have twill and boto installed

quick-n-dirty tutorial
 - lines starting with '>> ' define commands executed in the twill prompt
 - lines starting with '$ ' define commands executed in a terminal

Start twill and load the extension:
$ twill-sh
>> extend_with atm.twillm

Add new user credentials:
>> adduser me myAWSAccessKeyID myAWSSecretKey myAWSPrivateKey

This associates you accesskeyid, secretkey and your privatekey with the username
'me'. The username can be anything you want since it has nothing to do with
Amazon's services, though you should make it short for your own sake.

Add an image:
>> addimage myimage ami-a0c83ec9

This associates the image id 'ami-a0c83ec9' with the easier-to-remember string
'myimage'. Once again, like the user name, the image name has nothing to do
with Amazon and should be short so it is easy to remember.

Save these settings to a file:
>> savesettings mysettings

This saves the user and image information you entered to the file 'mysettings'.
If you want to load previously-saved settings from a file:
>> loadsettings mysettings

Now, lets start up an instance:
>> startinstance myimage me m1.xlarge

That command will fire up an m1.xlarge image. The instance type parameter is
optional and, if left out, defaults to 'm1.large'. After the instance is started,
its public DNS name is printed out below.

To get a listing of currently running instances:
>> showinstances

To stop an instance by specifying its ID:
>> stopinstance i-06e9ed6b

To stop all instances:
>> stopinstances

Which prints out each image ID as it is stopped

More Information:
 - All commands dealing with instances (startinstance, stopinstance,
   stopinstances, showinstances) take an optional 'username' parameter. This
   parameter defines the user credentials to execute the command under. If left
   unspecified, the command is executed using the first credentials stored in
   the container.
